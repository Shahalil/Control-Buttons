# Control-Buttons
Hello, friends!  
This project aims to record the commands for the robot's movements and store them in a database.  
Initially, the web page contains a user interface with five main buttons for the robot's movements. When the user clicks on one of these buttons, a message saying "Button added successfully" will appear. There's also a sixth button that redirects to another web page displaying the last button that was clicked and added to the database.
